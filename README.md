# People Analytics: Understanding Employee Performance

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores how **employee self-efficacy impacts performance**, with **engagement as a mediator** and **social support as a potential moderator**. The analysis is based on a conceptual framework using **Hayes' Process Model 7** for moderated mediation.

## 🔍 Business Problem
Organizations strive to improve employee performance through various interventions. This project aims to answer:
1. **Does self-efficacy influence performance?**
2. **Does engagement mediate this effect?**
3. **Does social support amplify this relationship?**

## 🏗️ Methodology
- **Dataset:** Cleaned and preprocessed employee performance data.
- **Model:** Moderated mediation analysis using **Process Model 7**.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Bootstrapping (10,000 samples) to assess the significance of indirect effects.

## 📊 Key Findings
- ✅ **Self-efficacy** positively influences **performance**.
- ✅ **Engagement** partially mediates this effect.
- ✅ **Social support enhances engagement**, improving performance.
- ❌ However, the **moderation effect** is not statistically significant.
